    "section": "",
    "text": "Procrastination is associated with a diminished future time perspective, where individuals prioritize immediate needs over long-term goals. However, individuals who perceive they have less time remaining in life may be less inclined to delay important actions. The purpose of this study was to explore how temporal orientation and subjective remaining life influence procrastination. This secondary analysis uses cross-sectional survey data of 143 participants aged 18-77. Participants completed measures of subjective life expectancy, consideration of future consequences, and procrastination. Latent class analysis and structural equation modelling were applied to the data to examine the potential moderating effects of temporal orientation and subjective remaining life on procrastination. Latent class analysis identified two temporal orientation classes: “neutral orientation (54.9%) and “highly future oriented” (45.1%). These classes were used in a structural equation model to assess moderation by subjective remaining life. The results revealed no moderating or direct effect of subjective remaining life on procrastination. However, high future orientation was negatively associated with decisional procrastination. Subjective perceptions of remaining life appear to have little influence on procrastination tendencies compared to temporal orientation. Individuals with a strong future orientation are better able to manage the temporal dilemmas that contribute to decisional procrastination, suggesting that future orientation plays a key role in reducing delay in decision-making"

    "text": "Abstract\nObjectives: To elicit research priorities for the topic of loneliness from experts and experts by experience in Ireland.\nMethods: There were two phases to this research. In Phase 1, 51 attendees of the inaugural meeting of a loneliness research network broke into roundtables to discuss different topics chosen a priori (loneliness in older people; loneliness and health; loneliness in young people; risk factors for loneliness; targeted interventions for loneliness; and loneliness and technology). Each table had a facilitator, and participants were asked to pick research priorities for that topic, shaped by Viergever’s checklist for health research priority setting. Phase 2 involved a survey created of all priorities emerging from Phase 1. The survey was shared with all members of the research network who were asked to rank them in order of importance. 22 network members completed the ranking survey.\nResults: Risk factors for loneliness (particularly an examination of why Ireland has the highest prevalence of loneliness across Europe), loneliness among young people (particularly measurement of prevalence) and older people (particularly the impact of financial challenges on loneliness), and loneliness interventions (particularly mapping existing interventions on loneliness in Ireland) were identified as the top research priorities.\nConclusions: With this prioritisation exercise complete, Irish loneliness researchers now have a roadmap for future research, which should be considered in future policies related to both loneliness and mental health research."

    "text": "Abstract\nProcrastination is an almost universal behaviour and yet little research to date has focused on procrastination among older adults. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential association between age and procrastination, and the potential mediating roles of depressive symptomatology and loneliness.Structural equation modelling was applied to data from 1309 participants (aged 29–92) from two waves United States Health and Retirement Study (2016–2020). Within the model, sex, education, marital status, and job status were added as covariates. There was no statistically significant direct effect between age and procrastination (\\(\\beta\\) = 0.06, p = 0.106). However, an indirect effect was present via depressive symptomatology (\\(\\beta\\) = −0.40, p &lt; 0.001). No mediating effect of loneliness was observed (\\(\\beta\\) = − 0.01, p = 0.371). Subsequent analysis revealed that the symptoms, fatigue, loneliness, and lack of motivation significantly predicted procrastination. While age was not directly associated with procrastination, increasing age was associated with a decreased likelihood of depressive symptomatology, which was in turn associated with an increased likelihood of procrastination. Such findings indicates that age demonstrates no association with procrastination because of the suppressing effect of depressive symptomatology."

    "text": "For the past few years I’ve been a statistics tutor in the psychology department at Maynooth University. We cover everything from the basics of descriptive statistics and graphs to the nitty-gritty of t-tests, correlations, and ANOVAs. However, there’s one topic where I always slow down and dive deep: regression analysis. Why? Because linear regression is basically the Swiss Army knife of statistics—it’s everywhere, it’s versatile, and it’s way cooler than it sounds.\nSeriously, linear regression is like that one friend who shows up at every party. Lectures? Check. Assignments? Obviously. Research papers? You bet. Even casual chats about data somehow always circle back to it. It’s the ultimate tool for understanding how variables play together. Whether you’re predicting exam scores based on study hours (or lack thereof) or calculating how much coffee it takes to survive finals week (spoiler: a lot), regression has your back.\nOne thing I always like doing is having students calculate regression coefficients by hand. It’s a great way to understand the mechanics of the model and appreciate the magic of least squares. But, full disclosure: I always forget the formulas mid-session and end up frantically Googling them. So, I decided to write them down here—partly for fun, partly as a future reference for myself (hey future me!!)."

    "text": "The linear regression model\nAt its core, linear regression is all about finding relationships between variables. The model is a simple equation that describes how a dependent variable (Y) relates to one or more independent variables (X). In its simplest form, it looks like this:\n Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X + \\epsilon \nwhere:\n\n\nY the dependent variable (the thing you’re trying to predict).\n\nX the independent variable (the thing you’re using to make predictions).\n\n\\beta_0 is the intercept (where the line crosses the Y-axis).\n\n\\beta_1 is the slope (how much Y changes for every unit change in X).\n\n\\epsilon the error term (because let’s face it, life is messy).\n\nGenerating some data\nFirst let’s load some packages and set our theme\n\n# Loading packages\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Setting default theme\ntheme_set(\n  theme_minimal() +\n    theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\", size = rel(1.4)),\n      axis.title = element_text(size = rel(1))\n      )\n)\n\nTo make this more concrete, let’s create a small dataset in R. We’ll simulate some data for study hours and exam scores, and then use linear regression to model the relationship between them.\n\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Hours of study per week (our x variable)\nstudy_hours &lt;- rnorm(10, mean = 7, sd = 2)\n\n# Exam scores (our y variable)\nexam_scores &lt;- 25 + 5 * study_hours + rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 2)\n\ntest_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  study_hours = ceiling(study_hours), \n  exam_scores = ceiling(exam_scores))\n\nhead(test_data)\n\n  study_hours exam_scores\n1           6          57\n2           7          59\n3          11          77\n4           8          61\n5           8          61\n6          11          81\n\n\nIf we plot this data we can see the relationship between study hours and exam scores:\n\nexam_plot &lt;- test_data |&gt;\nggplot(aes(x = study_hours, y = exam_scores)) +\n  geom_point(size = 4) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Exam scores vs. study hours\",\n    x = \"Study hours\",\n    y = \"Exam scores\"\n  )\n\nexam_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Scatter plot of exam scores vs. study hours. Each point represents a student’s exam score based on the number of study hours per week.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot, you can see a clear trend: the more hours a student spends studying, the higher their exam score tends to be. This is the relationship we want to model using linear regression.\nFitting a model in R\nIn R, fitting a linear regression model is as simple as using the lm() function. We provide the formula for the model and the dataset, and R does the rest. Let’s fit a linear model to our data:\n\nfit &lt;- lm(exam_scores ~ study_hours, data = test_data)\n\nbroom::tidy(fit)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic    p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)    21.3      3.93       5.42 0.000627  \n2 study_hours     5.23     0.496     10.5  0.00000569\n\n\nThe lm() function fits a linear model where exam_scores is the dependent variable (Y) and study_hours is the independent variable (X). The output gives us the estimated coefficients for the intercept (\\beta_0) and slope (\\beta_1).\n\nThe intercept (\\beta_0) is 21.33, meaning a student who studies 0 hours is predicted to score approximately 21% on the exam.\nThe slope (\\beta_1) is 5.23, indicating that for every additional hour of study, a student’s predicted exam score increases by 5.23%.\n\nVisually this looks like\n\nexam_plot &lt;- exam_plot +\n  geom_smooth(\n    method = \"lm\",\n    colour = ggokabeito::palette_okabe_ito(order = 5), \n    se = FALSE) +\n  # Adding equation of the line\n    annotate(\n      \"text\", x = 6, y = 80, \n    label = paste0(\n      \"Y = \", round(coef(fit)[1], 2), \" + \", round(coef(fit)[2], 2), \"X\"),\n    color = ggokabeito::palette_okabe_ito(order = 5), \n    size = rel(5), fontface = \"bold\"\n  )\n\nexam_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Scatter plot of exam scores vs. study hours with a linear regression line. The equation of the line is displayed on the plot.\n\n\n\n\nBut how are these values calculated"

The formulas for \\beta_0 and \\beta_1 are:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\beta_1 &= \\frac{\\sum(X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})}{\\sum(X_i - X)^2} \\\\[18pt]\n\n\\beta_0 &= \\bar{Y} - \\beta_1\\bar{X}\n\\end{align*}\nwhere:\n\n\nX_i and Y_i are the individual data points.\n\n\\bar{X} and \\bar{Y} are the means of the independent and dependent variables, respectively.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the means\nThe first step is to calculate the means of X and Y. These are the averages of the independent and dependent variables, respectively.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\bar{X} = \\frac{\\sum X_i}{n} = \\frac{77}{10} = 7.7 \\\\[12pt]\n\n\\bar{Y} = \\frac{\\sum Y_i}{n} = \\frac{616}{10} = 61.6\n\\end{align*}\nStep 2: Calculate the deviations from the mean\nNext, we calculate the deviations from the mean for each data point and their products.

    "section": "Agent Based Models",
    "text": "Agent Based Models\n\nOverview\nAgent-based models are computer simulations used to study the interactions between individuals, entities, environments, and time. These stochastic models are built from the bottom up, meaning individual agents (oftentimes representing people) are assigned specific attributes. The agents are programmed to behave and interact with other agents and their environment in predetermined ways, producing emergent effects that differ from the effects observed at the individual level.\n\nAgent-based models differ from the traditional regression-based methods in several key ways. For starters, regression-based methods focus on dependent and independent variables. Researchers often ask themselves What variables do I need to consider in my model?. In contrast, agent-based models shift the focus to dynamic processes, prompting the question What processes do I need to consider?.\n\n\nRegression-Based Methods\nIn regression-based methods, the primary goal is to identify and quantify the relationships between variables. For example, a researcher might want to understand the relationship between smoking and lung cancer. Using regression analysis, the researcher would collect data on smoking (independent variable) and lung cancer incidence (dependent variable), then apply statistical techniques to determine the strength and significance of the association.\n\nResearch Question: How does smoking affect the risk of lung cancer?\nIndependent Variable: Number of cigarettes smoked per day.\nDependent Variable: Incidence of lung cancer.\nOutcome: A statistical measure (e.g., odds ratio) that quantifies the increased risk of lung cancer associated with smoking.\n\n\n\nAgent Based Methods\nAgent based models, on the other hand, shift the focus to dynamic processes. These models focus on simulating the interactions between individual agents and their environment. Instead of looking solely at variable relationships, agent based models explore how processes and behaviors lead to emergent phenomena at the system level. This approach is particularly useful for studying complex systems where individual actions and interactions create outcomes that are not easily predictable from the behavior of individual agents alone.\n\nResearch Question: How does an infectious disease spread through a population?\nProcesses to Consider: Individual movement patterns, infection transmission rates, social interactions, and public health interventions.\nSimulation: Each agent represents a person who can move, interact, become infected, and recover or succumb to the disease. The model simulates how these processes unfold over time, providing insights into potential outbreak scenarios and intervention impacts.\n\nBy focusing on dynamic processes, ABMs allow researchers to capture the complexity of real-world systems. They provide a way to explore “what-if” scenarios and understand the potential effects of various interventions."

It allows users to create and explore complex systems through agent-based models, which consist of numerous individual entities, known as “agents,” that interact within a defined environment according to specific rules.\n\nKey Features\n\nAgents: The core of NetLogo models are agents, which can be of different types:\n\nTurtles: The primary agents that move around the world.\nPatches: The grid cells that make up the world; they don’t move but can change state.\nLinks: Connections between turtles that can represent relationships or flows.\nObserver: A special agent that monitors and controls the simulation.\n\nEnvironment: NetLogo’s world is typically a two-dimensional grid of patches where turtles move and interact. The environment can be customized to simulate various real-world scenarios, from ecosystems to traffic systems.\nProgramming Language: NetLogo uses a Logo-based programming language that for building both simple and complex models."

    "text": "What is multiple linear regression?\nIf simple linear regression is like baking a cake with just flour, multiple linear regression is like adding sugar, eggs, and butter to the mix. It’s a richer and more complex way of understanding relationships in your data.\nIn the real world, things are rarely influenced by just one factor. For example, your happiness isn’t just determined by how much coffee you drink (though that’s a big part of it). It’s also influenced by how much sleep you got, how many emails are in your inbox, and whether your cat decided to knock over your favorite mug. Multiple linear regression helps us model these kinds of multi-faceted relationships.\nThe equation\nAt its core, multiple linear regression is about finding the best-fitting linear relationship between multiple predictor variables (independent variables) and a response variable (dependent variable). The equation is similar to that of simple linear regression, but with more predictor variables:\n\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_jX_j + \\epsilon\n\nWhere:\n\n\nY is your dependent variable—the thing you’re trying to predict or explain. (Think: your happiness score.)\n\n\\beta_0 is the intercept. It’s the value of Y when all the predictor variables are zero. (If you drank no coffee, got zero sleep, and had no emails, how happy would you be? Probably not very.)\n\n\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\dots, \\beta_j are the coefficients for each predictor variable (X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_j). They tell you how much each predictor contributes to YY. (For example, does coffee make you happier than sleep? These coefficients will tell you!)\n\n\\epsilon is the error term. It accounts for the randomness in life that the model can’t explain. (Maybe your cat did something unpredictable, like actually not knocking over your mug.)\n\nThe goal of multiple linear regression is to find the values of \\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_j that minimize the sum of squared errors—basically, the difference between what the model predicts (\\hat{Y}) and what actually happens (Y). In other words, we’re trying to make our predictions as accurate as possible.\nGenerating some data\nFirst, let’s again load some packages and set up our theme.\n\n# Loading packages\nlibrary(ggplot2)    # For plotting\nlibrary(ggsci)      # Going with a simpsons theme \nlibrary(gghalves)   # Using half plots\nlibrary(dplyr)      # Data manipulation\nlibrary(tidyr)      # Data manipulation\n\n# Setting default theme\ntheme_set(\n  theme_minimal() +\n    theme(\n      panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\", size = rel(1.4)),\n      axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = rel(1)),\n      strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"grey80\", color = NA)\n      )\n)\n\nTo illustrate multiple linear regression, let’s generate some data. For this example, let’s stick with the happiness theme we have going. We’ll create a dataset with three predictor variables (X_1, X_2, X_3) representing daily coffee intake, sleep, and emails, and one response variable (Y) representing daily happiness.\n\nset.seed(321)\n\n# Generating our predictor variables\ncoffee &lt;- rnorm(10, mean = 2, sd = 1)   # Coffee intake (cups per day)\nsleep  &lt;- rnorm(10, mean = 7, sd = 1)   # Sleep (hours per night)\nemails &lt;- rnorm(10, mean = 10, sd = 3)  # Emails (received per day)\n\n# Generating our response variable\nhappiness &lt;- 5 + 0.2 * coffee + 0.7 * sleep - 0.2 * emails + rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n# Creating data set\nhappiness_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  happiness = ceiling(happiness),\n  coffee    = floor(coffee),\n  sleep     = ceiling(sleep),\n  emails    = ceiling(emails)\n)\n\nhead(happiness_data)\n\n  happiness coffee sleep emails\n1         7      3     8     13\n2        10      1     9     10\n3         9      1     8     13\n4        12      1    10      7\n5         8      1     6      8\n6         8      2     7     11\n\nView(happiness_data)\n\nBefore we dive into regression, let’s take a moment to visualize our data. We’ll use a combination of boxplots and jittered points to show the distribution of each variable\n\nhappiness_long &lt;- happiness_data |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = everything(),\n    names_to = \"variable\",\n    values_to = \"value\") |&gt;\n  mutate(variable = factor(\n    variable, levels = c(\"coffee\", \"sleep\", \"emails\", \"happiness\")))\n\nhappiness_plot &lt;- happiness_long |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = variable, y = value, fill = variable, colour = variable)) +\n  gghalves::geom_half_point(\n    transformation = ggbeeswarm::position_quasirandom(width = 0.1), \n    side = \"r\") +\n  gghalves::geom_half_boxplot(side = \"l\", colour = \"black\") +\n  scale_fill_simpsons() +\n  scale_colour_simpsons() +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(2, 12, by = 2)) +\n  labs(x = \"Variables\", y = \"Value\") +\n  guides(fill = \"none\", colour = \"none\")\n\nhappiness_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Visualising the distribution of our variables\n\n\n\n\nWhat Do We See?\nFrom the plot, we can start to get a sense of how our variables are distributed:\n\nCoffee intake hovers around 2-3 cups per day.\nSleep is mostly in the 7-8 hour range.\nEmails are all over the place, because inboxes are chaos.\nHappiness scores are a bit more spread out, reflecting the combined influence of coffee, sleep, and emails.\n\nThis visualization sets the stage for our regression analysis. Next up, we’ll dive into the math and find out exactly how much each of these factors contributes to happiness."

    "text": "Calculating coefficients (using matrices)\nWhile the manual method of calculating coefficients for multiple linear regression is a great way to understand the underlying mechanics, it can become tedious, especially when dealing with multiple predictor variables. Imagine having five or six predictors—the calculations would quickly become overwhelming! Fortunately, matrices provide a more efficient and streamlined approach.\nStep 1: Setting up our matrices\nTo begin, let’s define the key components of our regression model:\n\n\ny as the response variable\n\nX as the matrix of predictor variables\n\n\\beta as the vector of coefficients we want to estimate\n\n\\epsilon as the error term\n\nThe regression model can be expressed in matrix form as:\ny = X \\beta + \\epsilon\nOur goal is to solve for \\beta, the vector of coefficients. The least squares solution for \\beta is given by:\n\\beta = (X^TX)^{-1} X^Ty Let’s define the X matrix (including our intercept) and y matrix\n\nX = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 8 & 13 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 9 & 10 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 8 & 13 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 10 & 7 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 6 & 8 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 7 & 11 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 8 & 4 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 8 & 12 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} \\qquad\ny = \\begin{bmatrix}\n7 \\\\\n10 \\\\\n9 \\\\\n12 \\\\\n8 \\\\\n8 \\\\\n8 \\\\\n11 \\\\\n10 \\\\\n9 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 2: Transposing X\n\nThe next step is to compute the transpose of X denoted as X^T. Transposing a matrix involves flipping its rows and columns. For our X matrix, this results in:\n\nX^T = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n3 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n8 & 9 & 8 & 10 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 8 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n13 & 10 & 13 & 7 & 8 & 11 & 4 & 12 & 7 & 9 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 3: Computing matrix products\nWith X^T calculated, we now compute two key matrix products:\n\n\nX^TX: This product of the transposed predictor matrix and original predictor matrix.\n\nX^Ty: This product of the transposed predictor matrix and the response variable matrix.\n\nMatrix multiplication involves multiplying corresponding elements of each row and column. For example, the first element of the resulting matrix is the sum of the products of the first row of the first matrix X^TX and the first column of the second matrix X. To illustrate, the first two elements of X^TX would be:\n\n(1 \\times 1) + (1 \\times 1) + \\dots + (1 \\times 1) = 10 \\\\[8pt]\n(1 \\times 3) + (1 \\times 1) + \\dots + (1 \\times 1) = 16\n\nContinuing this process for all elements of X^TX and X^Ty results in:\n\nX^T X = \\begin{bmatrix}\n10 & 16 & 80 & 94 \\\\\n16 & 30 & 127 & 154 \\\\\n80 & 127 & 650 & 749 \\\\\n94 & 154 & 749 & 962 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} \\qquad\nX^T y = \\begin{bmatrix}\n92 \\\\\n143 \\\\\n746 \\\\\n859 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 4: Computing the inverse\nThe next step is to compute the inverse of X^TX, otherwise denoted as (X^TX)^{-1}. The inverse of a matrix is a special matrix that, when multiplied by the original matrix, yields the identity matrix. In other words:\n(X^TX)^{-1}(X^TX) = I\nwhere I is the identity matrix. The inverse of a matrix can be computed using various methods, with Gaussian elimination being one of the most common. Gaussian elimination transforms the matrix into row echelon form through a series of row operations, ultimately reducing it to the identity matrix.\n\nStart by augmenting X^TX with an identity matrix I such that [X^TX \\: \\vert \\: I]:\n\n\n[X^TX \\: \\vert \\: I] = \\begin{bmatrix}\n10 & 16 & 80 & 94 & \\vert & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n16 & 30 & 127 & 154 & \\vert & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n80 & 127 & 650 & 749 & \\vert & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n94 & 154 & 749 & 962 & \\vert & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\n\nPerform row operations to reduce the left side of the matrix to the identity matrix, resulting in the inverse of X^TX on the right side.\nThe resulting matrix on the right side will be the inverse of X^TX.\n\nFor my own mental sanity I will not perform this operation by hand, but rather use the solve() function in R to calculate the inverse of X^TX.\n\nXT_X &lt;- matrix(c(\n  10, 16, 80, 94,\n  16, 30, 127, 154,\n  80, 127, 650, 749,\n  94, 154, 749, 962\n), nrow = 4, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)\n\nsolve(XT_X) |&gt; round(digits = 3)\n\n       [,1]   [,2]   [,3]   [,4]\n[1,]  9.162 -0.456 -0.885 -0.133\n[2,] -0.456  0.240  0.021 -0.010\n[3,] -0.885  0.021  0.103  0.003\n[4,] -0.133 -0.010  0.003  0.013\n\n\nWe can then write (X^TX)^{-1} as:\n\n(X^TX)^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n9.162 & -0.446 & -0.885 & -0.133 \\\\\n-0.456 & 0.240 & 0.021 & -0.010 \\\\\n-0.885 & 0.021 & 0.103 & 0.003 \\\\\n-0.133 & -0.010 & 0.003 & 0.013\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 5: Computing \\beta\n\nWith (X^TX)^{-1} calculated, we can now compute \\beta using the formula:\n\\beta = (X^TX)^{-1} (X^Ty)\nMultiplying (X^TX)^{-1} by X^Ty gives us:\n\n\\beta = \\begin{bmatrix}\n3.239 \\\\\n-0.556 \\\\\n0.998 \\\\\n-0.261 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 6: Writing our regression equation\nFinally, we can write our regression equation:\ny = 3.239 - 0.556X_1 + 0.998X_2 - 0.261X_3\nBut wait, this isn’t what we got by doing it by hand, nor does it match the lm() output.\nThis is because the solve() function in R is able to calculate the inverse of a matrix without any rounding errors. This is not the case when doing it by hand. If I removed |&gt; round(digits = 3) from the above we get a much more precise estimate of (X^TX)^{-1}\n\nsolve(XT_X)\n\n           [,1]        [,2]         [,3]         [,4]\n[1,]  9.1623030 -0.45619804 -0.885469661 -0.132832858\n[2,] -0.4561980  0.24041444  0.020970344 -0.010237002\n[3,] -0.8854697  0.02097034  0.102990445  0.002978037\n[4,] -0.1328329 -0.01023700  0.002978037  0.013339124\n\n\nand then ultimately an exact match to the lm() output\n\nXT_y &lt;- matrix(c(92, 143, 746, 859), nrow = 4, ncol = 1, byrow = TRUE)\n\nsolve(XT_X) %*% XT_y\n\n            [,1]\n[1,]  3.03176573\n[2,] -0.74066261\n[3,]  0.92455640\n[4,] -0.00459114\n\n\nSo finally, we could say our regression equation is:\ny = 3.03 - 0.74X_1 + 0.92X_2 - 0.005X_3\nJust goes to show how much rounding makes a difference!"

    "text": "Abstract\nMaintaining health preventive behaviours in later life reduces the risk of non-communicable diseases. However, these behaviours often require effort and discipline to adopt and may be prone to procrastination. This study examined whether procrastination affected engagement in health preventive behaviours among older adults. We applied generalised additive models to data from the 2020 wave of the United States Health and Retirement Study. Our analytic sample consisted of adults aged 50+ \\((n = 1338; \\bar{x} = 68.24; \\text{range} = 50–95)\\). Our analysis focused on six health preventive behaviours: prostate exams, mammograms, cholesterol screenings, pap smears, flu shots, and dental visits. Procrastination was associated with less frequent engagement in mammograms and cholesterol screenings among women, though it had no significant association with pap smears or flu shots. Additionally, procrastination interacted with depression reducing the likelihood of prostate exams in men and dental visits in both men and women, such that individuals with high procrastination and low depression were associated with less frequent engagement in both preventive health behaviours. Procrastination may be a behavioral risk factor for maintaining optimal health in older adults. Given that procrastination is a potentially modifiable behaviour, interventions aimed at reducing procrastination, such as simplifying tasks or providing default appointment, could improve engagement in critical health preventive behaviours."
