    "text": "Abstract\nProcrastination is an almost universal behaviour and yet little research to date has focused on procrastination among older adults. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential association between age and procrastination, and the potential mediating roles of depressive symptomatology and loneliness.Structural equation modelling was applied to data from 1309 participants (aged 29–92) from two waves United States Health and Retirement Study (2016–2020). Within the model, sex, education, marital status, and job status were added as covariates. There was no statistically significant direct effect between age and procrastination (\\(\\beta\\) = 0.06, p = 0.106). However, an indirect effect was present via depressive symptomatology (\\(\\beta\\) = −0.40, p &lt; 0.001). No mediating effect of loneliness was observed (\\(\\beta\\) = − 0.01, p = 0.371). Subsequent analysis revealed that the symptoms, fatigue, loneliness, and lack of motivation significantly predicted procrastination. While age was not directly associated with procrastination, increasing age was associated with a decreased likelihood of depressive symptomatology, which was in turn associated with an increased likelihood of procrastination. Such findings indicates that age demonstrates no association with procrastination because of the suppressing effect of depressive symptomatology."

    "text": "Abstract\nOral reminiscence about autobiographical memory may serve a number of discursive functions for older adults. In this article we use a discursive psychological approach to analyse reminiscence discussions with four older Irish adults. A number of functions of reminiscence are evident in the discussion, including narrative, offering/seeking guidance, and building rapport with others. However, other putative functions of reminiscence, such as death preparation or obsessive/escapist, were less evident at an explicit level. Furthermore, the function of maintaining a sense of self is perhaps oversimplified, as changes in sense of self were confronted across different life periods within participants’ autobiographical memories. Reminiscence segued between first person, interpersonal and broader societal accounts, and employed counterfactual scenarios as well as direct descriptions of memory. The current methodology and findings indicate the complexity of autobiographical memory and how it is employed, and have relevance for discursive analysis of biographical materials from famous individuals from the past. The application of discursive psychological analysis to autobiographical texts will allow for understanding of how remarkable individuals have attempted to position themselves “for posterity”."

    "section": "Agent Based Models",
    "text": "Agent Based Models\n\nOverview\nAgent-based models are computer simulations used to study the interactions between individuals, entities, environments, and time. These stochastic models are built from the bottom up, meaning individual agents (oftentimes representing people) are assigned specific attributes. The agents are programmed to behave and interact with other agents and their environment in predetermined ways, producing emergent effects that differ from the effects observed at the individual level.\n Agent-based models differ from the traditional regression-based methods in several key ways. For starters, regression-based methods focus on dependent and independent variables. Researchers often ask themselves What variables do I need to consider in my model?. In contrast, agent-based models shift the focus to dynamic processes, prompting the question What processes do I need to consider?.\n\n\nRegression-Based Methods\nIn regression-based methods, the primary goal is to identify and quantify the relationships between variables. For example, a researcher might want to understand the relationship between smoking and lung cancer. Using regression analysis, the researcher would collect data on smoking (independent variable) and lung cancer incidence (dependent variable), then apply statistical techniques to determine the strength and significance of the association.\n\nResearch Question: How does smoking affect the risk of lung cancer?\nIndependent Variable: Number of cigarettes smoked per day.\nDependent Variable: Incidence of lung cancer.\nOutcome: A statistical measure (e.g., odds ratio) that quantifies the increased risk of lung cancer associated with smoking.\n\n\n\nAgent Based Methods\nAgent based models, on the other hand, shift the focus to dynamic processes. These models focus on simulating the interactions between individual agents and their environment. Instead of looking solely at variable relationships, agent based models explore how processes and behaviors lead to emergent phenomena at the system level. This approach is particularly useful for studying complex systems where individual actions and interactions create outcomes that are not easily predictable from the behavior of individual agents alone.\n\nResearch Question: How does an infectious disease spread through a population?\nProcesses to Consider: Individual movement patterns, infection transmission rates, social interactions, and public health interventions.\nSimulation: Each agent represents a person who can move, interact, become infected, and recover or succumb to the disease. The model simulates how these processes unfold over time, providing insights into potential outbreak scenarios and intervention impacts.\n\nBy focusing on dynamic processes, ABMs allow researchers to capture the complexity of real-world systems. They provide a way to explore “what-if” scenarios and understand the potential effects of various interventions."

    "text": "NetLogo\nDuring the workshop we developed and employed agent based models using the NetLogo software. Netlogo is a versatile, multi-agent programmable modeling environment widely used for simulating natural and social phenomena. It allows users to create and explore complex systems through agent-based models, which consist of numerous individual entities, known as “agents,” that interact within a defined environment according to specific rules.\n\nKey Features\n\nAgents: The core of NetLogo models are agents, which can be of different types:\n\nTurtles: The primary agents that move around the world.\nPatches: The grid cells that make up the world; they don’t move but can change state.\nLinks: Connections between turtles that can represent relationships or flows.\nObserver: A special agent that monitors and controls the simulation.\n\nEnvironment: NetLogo’s world is typically a two-dimensional grid of patches where turtles move and interact. The environment can be customized to simulate various real-world scenarios, from ecosystems to traffic systems.\nProgramming Language: NetLogo uses a Logo-based programming language that for building both simple and complex models."

This study aimed to examine how procrastination affects health and health behaviours in older adults. We conducted logistic regression analyses using data from the 2020 wave of the United States Health and Retirement Study. Our sample consisted predominantly of adults aged over 50 (n = 1368; mean = 68; range = 30 – 95). From the data we selected nine health outcomes reflecting various aspects of health status and behavior: heart condition, diabetes, cholesterol, blood pressure, fatigue, back pain, headaches, smoking, and alcohol consumption. We also selected six health protective behaviours: prostate exam, mammogram, cholesterol screening, pap smear, flu shot, and dental visit. Participants also completed measures of depressive symptomatology and procrastination. Findings: Our analysis revealed that procrastination was a significant positive predictor of all health outcomes (OR ranging from 1.01 to 1.05), except for having a heart condition. Procrastination was also a significant negative predictor of several health protective behaviors, such as getting a prostate exam, mammogram, cholesterol screening, and visiting the dentist (OR ranging from 0.98 to 0.99). Discussion: The results of this study suggest that procrastination is a risk factor for poor health and health behaviors in older adults. Procrastination may impair the ability or motivation of older adults to engage in preventive or curative health care, leading to worse health outcomes over time."

    "text": "Abstract\nProcrastination is an almost universal behaviour and yet little research to date has focused on procrastination among older adults. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential association between age and procrastination, and the potential mediating roles of depressive symptomatology and loneliness.Structural equation modelling was applied to data from 1309 participants (aged 29–92) from two waves United States Health and Retirement Study (2016–2020). Within the model, sex, education, marital status, and job status were added as covariates. There was no statistically significant direct effect between age and procrastination (\\(\\beta\\) = 0.06, p = 0.106). However, an indirect effect was present via depressive symptomatology (\\(\\beta\\) = −0.40, p &lt; 0.001). No mediating effect of loneliness was observed (\\(\\beta\\) = − 0.01, p = 0.371). Subsequent analysis revealed that the symptoms, fatigue, loneliness, and lack of motivation significantly predicted procrastination. While age was not directly associated with procrastination, increasing age was associated with a decreased likelihood of depressive symptomatology, which was in turn associated with an increased likelihood of procrastination. Such findings indicates that age demonstrates no association with procrastination because of the suppressing effect of depressive symptomatology."

    "section": "Agent Based Models",
    "text": "Agent Based Models\n\nOverview\nAgent-based models are computer simulations used to study the interactions between individuals, entities, environments, and time. These stochastic models are built from the bottom up, meaning individual agents (oftentimes representing people) are assigned specific attributes. The agents are programmed to behave and interact with other agents and their environment in predetermined ways, producing emergent effects that differ from the effects observed at the individual level.\n\nAgent-based models differ from the traditional regression-based methods in several key ways. For starters, regression-based methods focus on dependent and independent variables. Researchers often ask themselves What variables do I need to consider in my model?. In contrast, agent-based models shift the focus to dynamic processes, prompting the question What processes do I need to consider?.\n\n\nRegression-Based Methods\nIn regression-based methods, the primary goal is to identify and quantify the relationships between variables. For example, a researcher might want to understand the relationship between smoking and lung cancer. Using regression analysis, the researcher would collect data on smoking (independent variable) and lung cancer incidence (dependent variable), then apply statistical techniques to determine the strength and significance of the association.\n\nResearch Question: How does smoking affect the risk of lung cancer?\nIndependent Variable: Number of cigarettes smoked per day.\nDependent Variable: Incidence of lung cancer.\nOutcome: A statistical measure (e.g., odds ratio) that quantifies the increased risk of lung cancer associated with smoking.\n\n\n\nAgent Based Methods\nAgent based models, on the other hand, shift the focus to dynamic processes. These models focus on simulating the interactions between individual agents and their environment. Instead of looking solely at variable relationships, agent based models explore how processes and behaviors lead to emergent phenomena at the system level. This approach is particularly useful for studying complex systems where individual actions and interactions create outcomes that are not easily predictable from the behavior of individual agents alone.\n\nResearch Question: How does an infectious disease spread through a population?\nProcesses to Consider: Individual movement patterns, infection transmission rates, social interactions, and public health interventions.\nSimulation: Each agent represents a person who can move, interact, become infected, and recover or succumb to the disease. The model simulates how these processes unfold over time, providing insights into potential outbreak scenarios and intervention impacts.\n\nBy focusing on dynamic processes, ABMs allow researchers to capture the complexity of real-world systems. They provide a way to explore “what-if” scenarios and understand the potential effects of various interventions."

It allows users to create and explore complex systems through agent-based models, which consist of numerous individual entities, known as “agents,” that interact within a defined environment according to specific rules.\n\nKey Features\n\nAgents: The core of NetLogo models are agents, which can be of different types:\n\nTurtles: The primary agents that move around the world.\nPatches: The grid cells that make up the world; they don’t move but can change state.\nLinks: Connections between turtles that can represent relationships or flows.\nObserver: A special agent that monitors and controls the simulation.\n\nEnvironment: NetLogo’s world is typically a two-dimensional grid of patches where turtles move and interact. The environment can be customized to simulate various real-world scenarios, from ecosystems to traffic systems.\nProgramming Language: NetLogo uses a Logo-based programming language that for building both simple and complex models."

The numerical values (beta values) represent the strength and direction of the relationship between the variables. Statistically significant pathways are represented as ** p &lt; .01; *** p &lt; .001. The total effect of age on procrastination is (β = 0.010, p = 0.782)."

This study examined whether procrastination affected engagement in health preventive behaviours among older adults. We applied generalised additive models to data from the 2020 wave of the United States Health and Retirement Study. Our analytic sample consisted of adults aged 50+ \\((n = 1338; \\bar{x} = 68.24; \\text{range} = 50–95)\\). Our analysis focused on six health preventive behaviours: prostate exams, mammograms, cholesterol screenings, pap smears, flu shots, and dental visits. Procrastination was associated with less frequent engagement in mammograms and cholesterol screenings among women, though it had no significant association with pap smears or flu shots. Additionally, procrastination interacted with depression reducing the likelihood of prostate exams in men and dental visits in both men and women, such that individuals with high procrastination and low depression were associated with less frequent engagement in both preventive health behaviours. Procrastination may be a behavioral risk factor for maintaining optimal health in older adults. Given that procrastination is a potentially modifiable behaviour, interventions aimed at reducing procrastination, such as simplifying tasks or providing default appointment, could improve engagement in critical health preventive behaviours."

    "text": "Abstract\nObjectives: To elicit research priorities for the topic of loneliness from experts and experts by experience in Ireland.\nMethods: There were two phases to this research. In Phase 1, 51 attendees of the inaugural meeting of a loneliness research network broke into roundtables to discuss different topics chosen a priori (loneliness in older people; loneliness and health; loneliness in young people; risk factors for loneliness; targeted interventions for loneliness; and loneliness and technology). Each table had a facilitator, and participants were asked to pick research priorities for that topic, shaped by Viergever’s checklist for health research priority setting. Phase 2 involved a survey created of all priorities emerging from Phase 1. The survey was shared with all members of the research network who were asked to rank them in order of importance. 22 network members completed the ranking survey.\nResults: Risk factors for loneliness (particularly an examination of why Ireland has the highest prevalence of loneliness across Europe), loneliness among young people (particularly measurement of prevalence) and older people (particularly the impact of financial challenges on loneliness), and loneliness interventions (particularly mapping existing interventions on loneliness in Ireland) were identified as the top research priorities.\nConclusions: With this prioritisation exercise complete, Irish loneliness researchers now have a roadmap for future research, which should be considered in future policies related to both loneliness and mental health research."
