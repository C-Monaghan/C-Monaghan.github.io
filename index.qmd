Welcome! I am a data scientist with a focus on applying advanced statistical analysis and causal inference techniques to the **study of procrastination**, particularly within older adult populations. My [research](https://c-monaghan.github.io/research/) aims to uncover the underlying patterns, causal relationships, and consequences of procrastination behaviors, ultimately providing insights that could inform interventions and improve quality of life of older adults.

I am currently pursuing my PhD with the [Research Ireland Center for Research Training in Foundations in Data Science](https://www.data-science.ie/the-crt-programme/). This program is a large-scale collaborative initiative between the University of Limerick (UL), Maynooth University (MU) and University College Dublin (UCD) which aims to train over 130 PhD students with world-class foundational understanding in Applied Mathematics, Statistics and Machine Learning. My research is being conducted in the [Maynooth University Hamilton Institute](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/hamilton).
